              Inspired by her childhood memories of farms and gardens, Sangita Seth developed a deep appreciation for nature and the food it provides. As concerns about food adulteration and unnecessary additives grew, so did her desire to build something different — a food business guided by honesty, quality, and respect for what we eat.
            </p>
            <p className="bazaar-content-p">
              Together with Atul Seth and Akshat Seth, she turned that thought into Delmins — combining over 45 years of industrial and operational discipline with an unwavering commitment to 100% natural, preservative-free Indian foods.

            <p>
              We see Delmins as more than a business. It is a long-term commitment to creating products people value and a company they can trust.
            </p>
            <p>
              We understand that trust is earned through consistent quality, responsible choices, and the promises we keep. That belief guides us as we grow, innovate, and bring new products to more households.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our ambition is to build an enduring food company that combines the strength of experience with the courage to think differently — creating something meaningful for today's consumers and future generations.
